## Motivation
• The dataset was created to analyse monthly champagne sales data from 1964 to 1972 and understand the sales patterns and trends over time. It is primarily intended for time series forecasting and analysis.
• The dataset was made available as part of an online course on time series analysis.

## Composition
• The dataset comprises time series data for monthly champagne sales.
• There are 105 instances, each representing a specific month.
• The dataset contains some missing data, which was preprocessed before analysis.
• The dataset does not contain confidential or sensitive information.

## Collection Process
• The data was collected from historical records, possibly related to a champagne retailer.
• The dataset represents the entire period from 1964 to 1972.
• The exact collection process and the organization or entity responsible for data collection are not specified in the dataset.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling
• Preprocessing and cleaning were performed on the dataset, including handling missing values and transforming the data for analysis.
• Missing values were removed, and the "Month" column was converted to datetime format.
• Seasonal differencing was applied to make the data stationary.

## Uses
• The dataset can be used for time series forecasting and analysis.
• It can help predict future champagne sales and identify sales patterns.
• While the dataset itself does not contain confidential information, users should be cautious about making assumptions or decisions based on the predictions, as they rely on historical data patterns and may not account for external factors.
• The dataset should not be used for purposes other than time series analysis.

## Distribution
• The dataset was likely distributed as part of the online course and may be accessible through the course materials.
• The dataset's distribution rights and any applicable terms of use should be obtained from the source of the course materials.

## Maintenance
• The dataset's maintenance is not specified in the dataset itself.
• For questions about the dataset, maintenance inquiries should be directed to the source of the online course.
