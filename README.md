## Champagne Sales Time Series Forecasting Model

### Non-Technical Explanation of My Project

In this project, I analyzed historical champagne sales data from 1964 to 1972 to forecast future sales trends. By applying time series analysis, I aimed to understand sales patterns, seasonality, and make predictions to assist in decision-making.

### Data
I used a historical champagne sales dataset obtained from an online course on time series analysis. The dataset contains monthly sales figures from 1964 to 1972.

### Model
I employed SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting due to its ability to capture seasonal patterns in data.

### Hyperparameter Optimisation
Hyperparameters like the order and seasonal order were chosen based on the model's performance in fitting the dataset. I used grid search and trial-and-error to optimize these hyperparameters.

### Results
My model successfully captured the seasonality and trends in champagne sales data. I was able to make future sales predictions, aiding in decision-making for a hypothetical champagne retailer. The results are visually presented in my project report.
